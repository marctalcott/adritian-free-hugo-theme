      <em>The Software Engineer:<em><br>
      I've been coding since I was a kid.  I studied Computer Science at UNCG where I was recognized for excellence and invited to, and joined, the <a href="https://upe.acm.org/membership/">Upsilon Pi Epsilon Honor Society for Computer Science</a>.  I'm so happy that I have been able to spend most of adult life working as a software engineer. Now I love sharing what I've learned with others.
      <br>
      Currently I'm particulary interested in <a href="https://www.eventstore.com/event-sourcing">Event Sourcing</a> and its ability to provide a perfect audit log. As you can imagine that is critically important in finacial applications, but also in any application where you want to understand how people use your application.

    <em>The Farmer / Gardener:</em><br>
      One of the great things that came out of the Covid 19 pandemic was I started gardening in my backyard which has turned into a passion my wife and I share. We have a thriving organic garden and are now branching out into a larger scale farm and nursery called <em>'Talcott Farm and Nursery'</em>. This is an exciting new chapter for us.
